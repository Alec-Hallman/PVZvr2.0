Plants Versus Zombies VR (No longer in development)

## A new take on a classic
**Started out of my love for a childhood game I sought to bring into a new medium**

This project ended as unfinished but contained every plant from the first area in the original Plants Versus Zombies game. The only major feature this version is missing is a level selector, but besides that it is a fully functioning VR clone of Plants Versus Zombies.
